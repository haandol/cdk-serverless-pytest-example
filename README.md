# CDK Serverless Pytest Example

This project is an example for pythonistas on serverless land.

Writing unittest helps developers to collaborate with their colleagues especially when they are working on shared CDK Stacks.

Introducing application was inspired by Hit-Counter example on [CDKWorkshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript.html)

# Prerequisites

- git
- awscli
- Python 3.8
- Nodejs 14
- AWS Account and locally configured AWS credential

# Installation

install dependencies

```bash
$ cd infra
$ npm i -g cdk@1.129.0
$ npm i
$ cdk bootstrap
```

open [**config.ts**](infra/lib/constants/config.ts) and edit below variables (optional for prototyping).
1. *ns* - namespace for the project, default is `CdkSlsPytest`

deploy the CDK app to your account

```bash
$ cdk deploy "*" --require-approval never
```

# Run

install HTTPie, modernized CUrl

```bash
$ pip install httpie
```

update hit counter by requesting POST

```bash

$ cdk deploy ...

...
 âœ…  CdkSlsPytestApiGatewayStack (no changes)

Outputs:
CdkSlsPytestApiGatewayStack.HttpApiUrl = https://xxx.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/

$ http post https://xxx.execute-api.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/test
```

get count for the given path

```bash
